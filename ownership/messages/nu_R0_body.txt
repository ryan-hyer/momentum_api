To get the most out of Momentum, you will want to become what we call a Momentum Owner. To do that, simply go [here to become an Owner of Momentum and get full access to all content on the Discourse Community Forum.](#{@schedule.discourse.options[:instance]}/s)

The nominal $60 annual program fee covers the organization’s basic expenses and gives you full access to all community content on Discourse. Note: Momentum’s policy is to provide scholarships where there is financial need so that cost never becomes a deterrent to becoming an Owner.*

Welcome!
