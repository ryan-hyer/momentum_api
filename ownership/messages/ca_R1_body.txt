"Hi #{variable_hash['name']},

Heads up! Your Momentum Ownership will expire next week. Due to the [recent change in our fee structure](#{@schedule.discourse.options[:instance]}/t/basic-annual-fee-simplified/16450), we've turned off automatic renewal this year, so you will need to manually re-submit your credit card to continue your Momentum Ownership. Please [click this link](#{@schedule.discourse.options[:instance]}/s) within the next week to continue your Ownership without lapse.

If you ever need to make any changes to your Momentum Ownership, you can do so [here.](#{@schedule.discourse.options[:instance]}/s)
